#How to fetch data from amazon api to database using Django
1. Obtain an access token for the logged-in user by using Amazon's Login with Amazon service.
2. Use the access token to make a request to Amazon's Orders API to retrieve the user's order history.
3. Parse the response from the API to extract the relevant data.
4. Create a Django model that represents the data you want to store in the database, such as an "Order" model with fields for the order ID, date, total cost, etc.
5. Use Django's ORM to insert the data into the database.
6. You can also use an async task to fetch the data periodically, and have a cron job to schedule the task to run at a specific time.
7. Be sure to handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the process, and properly close the connection to the database when finished.
